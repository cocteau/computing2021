        "As we have mentioned, in this class our main language for computation will be [Python](http://www.python.org). It was chosen because of its emphasis on **readability and code sharing.** It is also exceedingly popular, with a large user community and an active group of contributors constantly adding new tools in the language. Not surprisingly, there are plenty of online sources to help you on your journey learning the language, from [cheatsheets](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/) to [online tutorials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python). You will quickly find that the web is a great place to find examples of code to do what you need to do. So, suppose you can't remember how to concatenate two strings...\n",

        "A word of caution: Make sure that when you find an answer on the web, it refers to **Python version 3.** There are two popular versions of the language in use, 2 and 3. This is a good example of eventually needing to move on from whatever technological environment you are used to — apps have upgrades, your phone's operating system asks to be upgraded, and programming languages evolve. I mean everything can get better, right? We are learning Python Version 3.\n",

        "This semester, we will program in Python (write and execute Python expressions) using the Jupyter notebook — the name \"Jupyter\" being a mix [Julia](http://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the three languages it originally supported. Programming with the notebook is often referred to as **\"literate computing\"** — by that we mean that you code a little, have a look, write a little, come up with more ideas, code a little more, write a little more and so on. To support this, as we have seen, Jupyter has two kinds of \"cells\" that you can either write or program in. Think of it as a modern reporter's notebook.\n",

You can also make lists like\n",

Software objects are a kind of programming abstraction, a particular way of organizing information and actions. Software objects try to mimic the notion of objects in the physical world — that means they contain properties or **data** and also might have certain operations or **methods** that you can use to transform the object in some way. Take as an example one of our lovely rolling chairs — it has operations (it can support you when you sit, it has a foldable arm for writing, and it can move around the room) as well as \"data\" (it has a seat height, a desk height, maybe even an RGB value specifying its lovely seat color).\n",
