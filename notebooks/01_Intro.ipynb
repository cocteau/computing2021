        "\n",
        "We'll start with some basic questions. First, the term *computational journalism.* What does it mean for journalism to be computational? In some sense, the use of computation in journalism is not new. Pulitzer himself wrote about how important \"data\" was to journalism.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://github.com/cocteau/computing2021/raw/main/images/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-25%20at%2011.59.05%20AM.png\" width=600>\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "In data he said we could find \"romance, human interest, humor and fascinating revelations.\"\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://github.com/cocteau/computing2021/raw/main/images/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-25%20at%2011.58.34%20AM.png\" width=400>\n",
        "\n",
        "In ways that Pulitzer probably could not have imagined, over the last few decades data and computing have become part of our everyday lives. They regulate and shape our interactions with the physical and virtual worlds. Organizations increasingly equate (though not without problems) \"data release\" with transparency. Sensing (sound, light, air quality) is cheap and plentiful, and easily deployed by the general public. Our actions online generate vast quantities of digital data. \n",
        "\n",
        "And, increasingly, computer systems exercise real power in the world through the insertion of machine learning (statistical models, artificial intelligence) alongside or in place of human decision making. In all of this, we can find new ways to ask questions about the world, how it's organized and how it functions. But the keys to this new digitized kingdom are data, code and algorithms. The curiosity, the questioning spirit, you developed last semester in your reporting classes finds an outlet in new and unexpected ways, mediated by data, code and algorithms. Hence, *computational journalism.* It is simply a response to our new condition of living in a computational society.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this year's edition of the course, we will be focusing on computational tools and techniques that, while not necessarily new, certainly achieved new prominence in the national election in 2016 and beyond. The vast networks of information that are created every day are simply too large for us to examine in their entirety. To get a sense of \"what's on,\" we take feeds from algorithmic recommender systems, we scan trending topics, we focus on information shared with us by our friends or people we trust. Recently, we have seen how these tools and strategies for directing our attention can be hacked. This year, we are going to place special emphasis on understanding machine learning or artificial intelligence and how it impacts journalism — from helping your reporting, to creating new kinds of story forms, to its use in the distribution of journalism.\n",
        "\n",

        "Along the way, we will cover a variety of topics that will help you in your journalistic practice, both in the sense that you better understand the media \"ecology\" you interact with daily, but also we will teach you to look to these systems as a source of stories, and even perhaps as a source of inspiration to build some kind of new platform to support journalism. We will learn a variety of tools, and our primary programming language will be Python. We will talk through how we came to this decision, but for the moment, know that it is a flexible language that lets you easily connect to networks like Twitter, assemble and analyze data from formal databases and the web, and build responsive services based on all these inputs. Over the next 12 weeks, we will introduce you to the following technologies and tools:\n",

The course assignments will be structured in ways that everyone has something new to do, with those needing less in the way of a technical introduction focusing on applications to reporting or the work of journalism broadly.\n",

        "<br><br>\n",
        "*Deliberation.* A rhetorically literate student understands that interface design problems are ill-defined problems whose solutions are representational arguments that have been arrived at through various deliberative activities.\n",

        "*Reflection.* A rhetorically literate student articulates his or her interface design knowledge at a conscious level and subjects their actions and practices to critical assessment.\n",

        "*Social action.* A rhetorically literate student sees interface design as a form of social versus technical action.\n",

The net effect is that some actions are natural, \"designed for\", easy, while others are hard. And this is the argument. It is the way that technology trains you to adopt its conventions, its embedded model of the world. You are led to do the easy things and avoid the hard things. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this class, we will spend a great deal of time learning a programming language, Python. And yes, any given coding language has its own model of the world and makes its own arguments for certain kinds of practices (certain metaphors for actually writing code). But with a coding language comes almost unbounded flexibility to create. Unlike many of the designed systems we interact with, coding gives us the freedom to build, to imagine the world in new ways. \n",
        "\n",
        "All of these ideas take on particular resonance with our theme, \"Hacking your attention.\" We are inviting you to not only investigate existing algorithms for computing \"trending topics,\" but also to try out your own ideas about how this should be done. In an age when people are arguing for \"algorithmic accountability\" and \"explainable\" artificial intelligence\", it's the perfect time to consider a reporting practice that investigates by building.
